# autonav_Crazyflie_Turtlebot3

**Multi-Agent Robot Sensing Simulation and also real-world deployment**

This project simulates autonomous navigation and pollutant density mapping using multiple robots, in this case Turtlebot3 as UGV and Crazyflie 2.x as UAV.
It leverages ROS (Robot Operating System) and Gazebo to model collaborative sensing behaviors in a shared environment. This github repo should help you integrate Crazyflie and Turtlebot3 in the capsulated ROS environtment.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - ROS (Robot Operating System) installed.
   - Gazebo simulator set up.

2. **Installation**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Adrian-Jotham/autonav_CF_TB.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory and build:
     ```bash
     cd autonav_CF_TB
     catkin_make
     ```

3. **Running the Simulation**:
   - Launch the simulation environment:
     ```bash
     roslaunch launch/your_launch_file.launch
     ```
   - Replace `your_launch_file.launch` with the appropriate launch file name.
   - Real World Deployment 
      Please look for "tb_cf.launch" launcher file
   - Random Simulation and Implementation also provided in the launch file utilizing different random movements.
